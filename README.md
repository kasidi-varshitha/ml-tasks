Certainly! Credit card detection is often approached as a binary classification problem in machine learning. Here's a simple example using Python and the scikit-learn library:

python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv("credit_card_data.csv")

# Separate features and target variable
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)
y = data['Class']

# Split data into train and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Train Random Forest classifier
clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on test set
y_pred = clf.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


Make sure to replace "credit_card_data.csv" with the path to your dataset file. This code assumes your dataset has features labeled as columns and a target variable named 'Class' indicating whether a transaction is fraudulent or not. You might need to preprocess your data or adjust the model parameters based on your specific dataset and requirements.
